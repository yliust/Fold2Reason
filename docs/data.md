# Data and resource contracts

## External inputs

| Input | Expected local form | Included? |
|---|---|---|
| Base model | Model, tokenizer and config files in a Hugging Face-compatible directory | No |
| Training protein records | Disjoint train/dev/test BB4Q10 chat JSONL | No |
| FoldBench | `monomer_protein` directory with manifest/targets and available MSA/templates | No |
| General-10 datasets | Dataset-specific files consumed by `evaluation.general_text`, `evaluation.ftb`, and `evaluation.multimodal` | No |
| Frozen decoder and adapters | Checkpoint directories from the documented training stages | Generated separately |
| Synthetic example | `examples/toy_protein.json` | Yes |

Obtain each external resource from its original publisher and preserve its terms and version. Dataset licenses and model licenses are separate from this code's license. The local research benchmark directory layout is supported, but downloading and redistribution of those datasets is not automated by this release.

## Geometry cache

`data.geometry_cache` parses the BB4Q10 assistant target and replaces the coordinate target in the language-model input with one marker per residue. Targets remain separate tensors. Rows include `id`, `sequence`, `input_ids`, `marker_positions`, `target_coords`, `residue_mask`, and auxiliary geometry targets. The cache uses `splits` with `train`, `validation`, and `validation_rare`.

Input target syntax and tokenization are defined by `parse_backbone`, `build_skeleton`, and `tokenize_record`. Treat them as the executable schema; `fold2reason data geometry --help` lists the file overrides. The tokenizer must recognize the configured residue marker as one token.

## FoldingCorpus

`data.folding_corpus` deterministically derives contact, distance ordering, orientation, center-distance, local-frame, chirality, multi-constraint, and topology-identification labels. It saves question arguments and evidence so labels can be recomputed from the source coordinates.

The training cache keeps the established `bridge`, `relation_*`, and related checkpoint keys for compatibility. They denote FoldingCorpus supervision in the public terminology. Renaming these serialized keys would invalidate existing caches/checkpoints, so public naming is separated from the storage schema.

The toy example is hand-constructed and identifies itself as synthetic. It illustrates a contact-label rule and is not a protein from a training or evaluation dataset. It is not a full tokenizer-dependent training cache.

## Trust boundary

Training caches and checkpoints use PyTorch serialization, including `torch.load(..., weights_only=False)` for structured caches. Load only files you created or obtained from a trusted source. Model code requiring `trust_remote_code=True` must be reviewed separately. Authentication belongs in your local environment or Hugging Face credential store, never in committed configuration files.
